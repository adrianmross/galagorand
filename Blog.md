If you found this tutoiral interesting or helpful and want to see more tutorial please leave a star!

Disclaimer: Iâ€™m not affiliated with Unity and this project is not audited and should not be used in a production environment. The Unity demo is a modified version of a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH9IHdp1dyU&list=PL6ynPcXXvDY_9nYW_S-nAliA1w1mARm8x&pp=iAQB) by Justin. I highly recommend checking out his channel to learn more about Unity and game development.

## Requirements

1. An IDE to code. Visual Studio for Windows is recommended because of its integration with Unity and other tools in the ecosystem like Algorand for Visual Studio (AlgoStudio) extension which comes in handy for smart contracts. Visual Studio Code is also doable when  working with just Unity, and is what I used primarily, but requires an extensive setup.
2. Unity Hub and Unity installed, in addition to a basic understanding of how to develop Unity projects.
3. Algorand SDK for Unity installed. This is a Unity package that allows you to interact with the Algorand blockchain from within Unity. It is a wrapper around the Algorand SDK for C#. It is now downloadable from the Unity Asset Store.
4. Indexer such as AlgoExplorer or DappFlow to see the transactions on the blockchain.
5. Docker - used in running a testnet node. This is optional, but recommended. You can also use a node from a third party provider like AlgoExplorer.

## Background

### The Potential of ASAs

NFTs have taken the last few years by storm. They are a new way to represent ownership of digital assets. They are unique, non-interchangeable, and can be used to represent things outside of the standard token. However, the hype as of late has stagnated due to the common perception equating them to 2d variations of an ape. While this is one use case, NFTs have the potential to be so much more. They can be used to represent ownership of physical assets, like a house or a car. They can be used to represent ownership of a digital asset, like a video game item or a song.

Algorand is the perfect blockchain to build these NFTs on. Not only is it a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain, but has a built in feature that makes it easy to create and manage NFTs. It is called Algorand Standard Assets (ASA), which provide a standardized, Layer-1 mechanism to represent any type of asset on the Algorand blockchain.

### Scrolling SHMUP Game

The game we will be building is a scrolling shoot-em-up (SHMUP) game. The player controls a spaceship that can move up and down and shoot blaster beams. The goal of the game is to shoot down as many enemy spaceships as possible without getting hit. The player has three lives, and the game ends when the player loses all three lives. The player can collect powerups to increase their firepower and score. Read more about what makes a good [SHMUP game](https://www.racketboy.com/retro/shmups-101-a-beginners-guide-to-2d-shooters).

Once again, as of now, all assets and most of the Unity code was developed by Justin. He has a step by step series that you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH9IHdp1dyU&list=PL6ynPcXXvDY_9nYW_S-nAliA1w1mARm8x&pp=iAQB).

This tutorial covers the building of a script using the Algorand SDK to reward players with ASA Game Tokens. The script is written in C# and is used in a Unity game to interact with the Algorand blockchain. It provides functionality to generate a new Algorand account, check the status of the Algod and Indexer clients, retrieve an asset from the blockchain, opt into the asset, and send the asset to another account. The script also includes some additional functionality related to the game, such as updating the balance and displaying it on the UI.

1. Setup

To get started, you need to have Unity installed. You can download Unity from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). You also need to have the Algorand SDK for Unity installed. You can download it from the Unity Asset Store [here](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/algorand-sdk-for-unity-2020-3-0-180974).

Then we need the demo project. You can either download from the repository or download the unedited version from Justin's [project](https://ko-fi.com/s/599bd0fd0b). Please support him if you can!

Once you have the project, open it in Unity. Navigate to the Unity Asset Store and import the Algorand SDK for Unity package. Then navigate to the Algorand SDK for Unity folder in the Project window. Follow the AlgorandSDK CreateAsas Sample to create a new creator account and game token. Make sure to record the asset ID and creator account mnemonic.

1. Build the Algo UI

The best way to add the Algo script to your Unity project is to create a Game Object that is persistent throughout the game. The best game object therefore would be a UI element that gets updated throughout the game. 

Create a prefab of a UI element that will be used to display the balance of the asset. We first need a canvas to hold the UI elements. Right click in the hierarchy and select UI > Canvas. Then right click on the canvas and select UI > Text. This will create a text element that will be used to display the balance. You can change the text to whatever you want, but make sure to keep the name as "BalanceText". You can also change the font, font size, and color.

1. Starting the Algo.cs Script

### Dependencies

The script requires the following dependencies:

- Algorand.Unity: A library that provides Algorand blockchain integration for Unity.
- Algorand.Unity.Indexer: A library that provides Algorand indexer integration for Unity.
- System.Collections: A standard library for working with collections in C#.
- UnityEngine: The Unity engine library.
- Cysharp.Threading.Tasks: A library for asynchronous programming in C#.
- UnityEngine.UI: A library for working with UI elements in Unity.

Make sure to import these dependencies in your Unity project before using the script.

### Class Structure

The `Algo` class extends the `MonoBehaviour` class, which is the base class for Unity scripts. It includes various fields, methods, and lifecycle callbacks to interact with the Algorand blockchain and handle game-related functionality.

### Fields

- `instance`: A static field representing the singleton instance of the `Algo` class.
- `algod`: An instance of the `AlgodClient` class used for interacting with the Algod client.
- `indexer`: An instance of the `IndexerClient` class used for interacting with the Indexer client.
- `algodHealth`: A string representing the health status of the Algod client.
- `indexerHealth`: A string representing the health status of the Indexer client.
- `account`: An instance of the `Algorand.Unity.Account` class representing the Algorand account.
- `txnStatus`: A string representing the status of a transaction.
- `asset`: An instance of the `Asset` class representing an asset on the Algorand blockchain.
- `balance`: An integer representing the balance of the asset.
- `balanceText`: A `Text` component representing the UI element to display the balance.
- `assetId`: An unsigned long representing the ID of the game token ASA (Algorand Standard Asset) on the testnet.

4. Awake Method

```csharp
// Awake is called when the script instance is being loaded
    private void Awake()
    {
        if (instance == null)
        {
            instance = this;
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
            balanceText = GameObject.Find("BalanceText").GetComponent<Text>();
        }
        else
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
    }
```

 `Awake()`: This method is called when the script instance is being loaded. It initializes the singleton instance, sets the `balanceText` field by finding the corresponding UI element, and generates or retrieves the Algorand account based on whether the account mnemonic is stored in PlayerPrefs.

5. Start Method

```csharp
// Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Start");
        // if account not connected, generate new account
        // this is a temporary solution, and NOT secure and should only be used for testing. wallet connect will be implemented in the future
        if (PlayerPrefs.GetString("users_local_mnemonic") == "")
        {
            Debug.Log("Generating new account");
            var (privateKey, address) = Algorand.Unity.Account.GenerateAccount();
            account = new Algorand.Unity.Account(privateKey);
            Debug.Log($"My address: {account.Address}");
            var mnemonic = privateKey.ToMnemonic();
            Debug.Log($"My mnemonic: {mnemonic}");
            UnityEngine.Application.OpenURL($"https://dispenser.testnet.aws.algodev.network/?account={account.Address}"); // dispenser for testing
            PlayerPrefs.SetString("users_local_mnemonic", mnemonic.ToString());
            PlayerPrefs.Save(); // NOT SECURE

            // AssetAccept
            AcceptAsset().Forget();
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log("Account already exists");
            Mnemonic mn = Mnemonic.FromString(PlayerPrefs.GetString("users_local_mnemonic"));
            account = new Algorand.Unity.Account(mn.ToPrivateKey());
        }
        // replace with your node address
        algod = new AlgodClient("https://node.testnet.algoexplorerapi.io");
        CheckAlgodStatus().Forget();
        CheckIndexerStatus().Forget();
    }
```

`Start()`: This method is called before the first frame update. It initializes the `algod` client, checks the status of the Algod and Indexer clients, and performs asset acceptance if a new account is generated.

6. Check Status Methods

```csharp
// Check the status of the algod client
    public async UniTaskVoid CheckAlgodStatus()
    {
        var response = await algod.HealthCheck();
        if (response.Error) algodHealth = response.Error;
        else algodHealth = "Connected";
    }
```

`CheckAlgodStatus()`: This method asynchronously checks the status of the Algod client and updates the `algodHealth` field accordingly.

```csharp
// Check the status of the indexer client
    public async UniTaskVoid CheckIndexerStatus()
    {
        var response = await indexer.MakeHealthCheck();
        if (response.Error) indexerHealth = response.Error;
        else indexerHealth = "Connected";
    }
```

`CheckIndexerStatus()`: This method asynchronously checks the status of the Indexer client and updates the `indexerHealth` field accordingly.

1. Get Asset Method

```csharp
// Get the asset
    public async UniTaskVoid GetAsset()
    {
        var apiResponse = await indexer.LookupAssetByID(assetId);
        if (apiResponse.Error) Debug.LogError(apiResponse.Error);
        else {
            Debug.Log("Successfully retrieved asset");
            Debug.Log($"Asset: {apiResponse.GetText()}");
            AssetResponse assetResponse = apiResponse.Payload;
            asset = assetResponse.Asset;
        }
        Debug.Log($"Asset: {asset.Params.Creator.ToString()}");
    }
```

`GetAsset()`: This method asynchronously retrieves the asset from the Algorand blockchain using the `indexer` client and updates the `asset` field.

Since we are using the indexer we need to `await` the response. The indexer is a separate service that indexes the blockchain and provides a fast and efficient way to query the blockchain. Therefore all calls to the indexer are asynchronous and cannot be run in the `Start()` method.

8. Opting Into the Asset Method

Before we can send the asset to another account, we need to opt into the asset by sending a transaction to the Algorand blockchain. This is done by calling the `AssetAccept` method on the `Algorand.Unity.Account` instance.

```csharp
// Opt into the asset
    public async UniTaskVoid AcceptAsset()
    {
        var opter = $"{account.Address}";
        var algod = new AlgodClient("https://node.testnet.algoexplorerapi.io");
        var (txnParamsError, txnParams) = await algod.TransactionParams();
        if (txnParamsError)
        {
            Debug.LogError(txnParamsError);
            txnStatus = $"error: {txnParamsError}";
            return;
        }
        var xferAsset = assetId;
        var optinTxn = Algorand.Unity.Transaction.AssetAccept(opter, txnParams: txnParams, xferAsset);
        var signedTxn = account.SignTxn(optinTxn);

        // Send the transaction
        var (sendTxnError, txid) = await algod.SendTransaction(signedTxn);
        if (sendTxnError)
        {
            Debug.LogError(sendTxnError);
            txnStatus = $"error: {sendTxnError}";
            return;
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log("Sender Account = " + account.Address);
            Debug.Log("Transaction sent, TxID = " + txid.TxId.ToString());
        }

        // Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
        var (confirmErr, confirmed) = await algod.WaitForConfirmation(txid.TxId);
        if (confirmErr)
        {
            Debug.LogError(confirmErr);
            txnStatus = $"error: {confirmErr}";
            return;
        }
    }
```

`AcceptAsset()`: This method asynchronously opts into the asset by sending a transaction to the Algorand blockchain.


When the code is run, the following transaction can be seen on the Algorand testnet:

9. Sending the Asset Methods

The principal method for sending the asset to another account is the `SendAsset` method.

```csharp
// Send the asset to the user
    public async UniTaskVoid SendAsset(string receiver, Address sender, ulong amount)
    {
        // make sender account from mnemonic, this is a temporary solution, and NOT secure and should only be used for testing. a game server is the only place to hold the private key
        Mnemonic senderMnemonic = Mnemonic.FromString("...");
        Algorand.Unity.Account senderAccount = new Algorand.Unity.Account(senderMnemonic.ToPrivateKey());

        var algod = new AlgodClient("https://node.testnet.algoexplorerapi.io");
        var (txnParamsError, txnParams) = await algod.TransactionParams();
        if (txnParamsError)
        {
            Debug.LogError(txnParamsError);
            txnStatus = $"error: {txnParamsError}";
            return;
        }
        var xferAsset = assetId;

        var xferTxn = Algorand.Unity.Transaction.AssetTransfer(sender,txnParams, xferAsset, amount, receiver);
        var signedTxn = senderAccount.SignTxn(xferTxn);

        // Send the transaction
        var (sendTxnError, txid) = await algod.SendTransaction(signedTxn);
        if (sendTxnError)
        {
            Debug.LogError(sendTxnError);
            txnStatus = $"error: {sendTxnError}";
            return;
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.Log("Sender Account = " + account.Address);
            Debug.Log("Transaction sent, TxID = " + txid.TxId.ToString());
        }

        // Wait for the transaction to be confirmed
        var (confirmErr, confirmed) = await algod.WaitForConfirmation(txid.TxId);
        if (confirmErr)
        {
            Debug.LogError(confirmErr);
            txnStatus = $"error: {confirmErr}";
            return;
        }

        // update balance
        balance += (int)amount;
        balanceText.text = balance.ToString();
    }
```

`SendAsset(string receiver, Address sender, ulong amount)`: This method asynchronously sends the asset to the specified receiver by creating and sending a transaction to the Algorand blockchain. It also updates the balance and the `balanceText` UI element

We then need to call this method from the `waiter` coroutine so that the asset is first indexed before sending it.

```csharp
// Waiter is used to wait for 2 seconds before sending the asset, this is to ensure that the asset is created before sending
    IEnumerator waiter()
    {
        GetAsset().Forget();
        //Wait for 2 seconds
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(1);
        
        Address assetCreator = asset.Params.Creator;
        ulong assetAmount = ulong.Parse(asset.Params.Total.ToString());

        Debug.Log($"Asset amount: {assetAmount}");
        // reward amount, can be changed and based on game logic
        ulong rewardAmount = 10;
        if (assetAmount - rewardAmount < 0)
        {
            Debug.Log("Not enough ASA to send");
        }
        // send asa to user, this is a temporary solution, and NOT secure and should only be used for testing. a game server is the only place to hold the private key and therefore this operation should send a request to the server to send the asset
        else
        SendAsset(account.Address, assetCreator, 10).Forget();
    }
```

`waiter()`: This coroutine is used to wait for 2 seconds before sending the asset. It retrieves the asset and then waits for the specified time before calling the `SendAsset` method.

`WrappedSendAsset()` is called to initiate the process of sending the asset to another account. It starts a coroutine named `waiter` and is called from the `Update()` method in `Level.cs` when the player finishes all the levels.

When the code is run, the following transaction can be seen on the Algorand testnet:
![image]("blog-images/send-asset screenshot.png")

10. Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Import the required dependencies (`Algorand.Unity`, `Algorand.Unity.Indexer`, `System.Collections`, `UnityEngine`, `Cysharp.Threading.Tasks`, and `UnityEngine.UI`) into your Unity project.
2. Attach the `Algo` script to a GameObject in your scene.
3. Make sure you have a UI element with the name "BalanceText" to display the balance.
4. Ensure that you have a valid Algorand node URL and indexer URL specified in the code (replace the placeholders with the correct URLs).
5. Call the appropriate methods from other scripts or UI buttons to interact with the Algorand blockchain (e.g., `WrappedSendAsset()` to initiate the asset transfer process).
6. Customize the code as per your specific requirements and integrate it into your game logic.

Please note that this documentation provides a general overview of the script's functionality. It's recommended to have a good understanding of Algorand blockchain integration and Unity development before using this script in a production environment.


11. Done!

You can use the Unity editor to run the game. You can also build the game for Windows, Mac, or Linux. To do this, go to File > Build Settings, select the platform you want to build for, and click Build. This will create a build in the specified folder. You can even run a test run by just clicking the play button in the Unity editor. View the debug logs in the console to see the status of the Algorand client and the transactions.

13. A Building Block to Much More
Some ideas that you can implement to improve this demo and make an even more complex game ready for production:

Add a wallet to the game so that players can see their balance and send the ASA to other accounts.
Add a leaderboard to the game so that players can see the top players using a smart contract.
Add a game server to the game so the private key of the transaction is not stored on the client side.
Refactor. This is just one solution, but itâ€™s definitely not the best solution. Improve it or write a better solution!
